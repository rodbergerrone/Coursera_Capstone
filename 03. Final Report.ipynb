    "_\"ABC123 is a leading American consulting company based in New York City, Manhattan. ABC123 employs English-speaking personnel, specialized in law, finance, audits, etc._\n",
    "\n",
    "_ABC123 wants to explore business opportunities in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). ABC123 would like to establish a common office for entire CEE region and move some of current American personnel to the new location. It is expected that the new office will be in the capitol of the European Union member that joined after 2000. The new location must be comparable to Manhattan when it comes to social life (e.g. restaurants and entertainment). Second factor to compare is flight network, especially frequency of direct flights between New York City and particular location, and between analyzed locations themselves, that would lead to selection of an optimal place to run business. Last factor to compare would be: cost of life and presence of English-spoken schools since the US-personnel will be relocated with families.\"_\n",

    "k-means clustering is defined by Wikipedia as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances. For instance, better Euclidean solutions can be found using k-medians and k-medoids.\"_\n",

    "k-means clustering was used here either to:\n",
    "- compare the similarities of 8 cities, including Lower Manhattan, after exploration of venues in the cities. This part of analysis was meant to answer which city is similar to Lower Manhattan in terms of social life\n",
    "- compare the similarities of 7 cities, excluding Lower Manhattan, after exploration of flight network, cost of living and presence of English-spoken schools. This part of analysis is to shed light on the best location in terms of doing business, business travels in the region and living with families, including children in school age."
